# hello-world
 Repository for storing my project stuff
**My name is Tala**
I'm still a little confused on how GitHub works, but I'm learning. 
My brother is a programmer and he raves about GitHub and how great it is, so I'm excited to figure it out!
I think this will help me in my new career and that is also exciting!
